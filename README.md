## **Overview**

The Fantasy Robotics League App is a web platform where users can create leagues, draft robotics teams, and score them based on real-world performance in FIRST Robotics Competitions (FRC). Users can monitor team performance weekly, propose trades, and compete with friends for the top spot in their league. No user authentication is necessary, since the only write changes are done using the associated discord bot, which grabs the user ID given by the Discord webhook. The Discord bot facilitates all write operations, such as creating leagues, drafting teams, and proposing trades. These actions are synchronized with the web app, allowing users to track changes and view rankings without requiring login on the website.

## **Features**

- **League Management:** Create and join multiple leagues with custom rules.
- **Fantasy Draft:** Conduct live drafts to select teams from a pool of teams specific to the draft or league.
- **Trade System:** Propose and accept trades between teams.
- **Team Rankings:** View weekly and cumulative rankings based on team performance.
- **API Integration:** Data sourced from real FRC events, using [The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs).

## **Technologies**

- **Backend:** Python (Flask, SQLAlchemy, Discord.py)
- **Frontend:** React, Bootstrap
